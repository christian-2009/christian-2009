### Projects
<b>Full Stack Study Resource App</b> 📚 <br/> 
Allowed users to login, post recommended resources, like, dislike and comment on other posted resources. Users could also add resources to a 'to read' list.
<ul>
  <b><a href= 'https://github.com/christian-2009/Study-Resource-Catalog-App-Frontend'>Front-end Repo</a></b><br/>
  <b><a href= 'https://github.com/christian-2009/Study-Resource-Catalog-App-Backend'>Back-end Repo</a></b><br/>
  <b><a href = 'https://academy-study-resources.netlify.app/'>Deployed Wesbite</a></b><br/>
</ul>

<b>Front-end Consulting project</b> 🕴️<br/> 
Took Dummy data about projects which involved clients and employees and displayed it on the screen. This list could be filtered and sorted. I also allowed users to see individual employees and clients using React Router. Had to stitch the different data together in order to get all the information required. NOTE: the api is slow so the website can take some time to load the data in.

</ul>

<b>Full Stack Todo App</b> 📝<br/>
Created a full stack todo app that allows the user to post todo, remove them and change them to grey when they are being completed.
  <ul>
  <b><a href= 'https://github.com/christian-2009/todo-app-frontend'>Front-end Repo</a></b><br/>
  <b><a href= 'https://github.com/christian-2009/todo-app-backend'>Back-end Repo</a></b><br/>

</ul>

<b>Front-end Cat App</b> 🐱<br/> 
Took data from 'thecatapi' to display a new cat when the new cat button is pressed. I also used the API to display the favourite cats when the favourite button is pressed. This project taught me about sending headers in API requests. Furthermore, I applied responsive web design techniques to this project.
