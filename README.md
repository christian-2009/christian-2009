### Projects
<b>Full Stack Study Resource App</b> 📚 <br/> 
Allowed users to login, post recommended resources, like, dislike and comment on other posted resources. Users could also add resources to a 'to read' list.
<ul>
  <li><a href= 'https://github.com/christian-2009/Study-Resource-Catalog-App-Frontend'>Front-end Repo</a></li>
  <li><a href= 'https://github.com/christian-2009/Study-Resource-Catalog-App-Backend'>Back-end Repo</a></li>
  <li><a href = 'https://academy-study-resources.netlify.app/'>Deployed Wesbite</a></li>
</ul>

<b>Front-end Consulting project</b> 🕴️<br/> 
Took Dummy data about projects which involved clients and employees and displayed it on the screen. This list could be filtered and sorted. I also allowed users to see individual employees and clients using React Router. Had to stitch the different data together in order to get all the information required.
